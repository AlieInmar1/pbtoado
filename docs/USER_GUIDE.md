## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose of the Integration

The ProductBoard to ADO (Azure DevOps) Integration system bridges the gap between product management in ProductBoard and development tracking in Azure DevOps. This integration allows product managers and development teams to:

- Maintain a single source of truth for product requirements
- Automatically synchronize features from ProductBoard to work items in ADO
- Preserve hierarchy relationships between objectives, initiatives, and features
- Track feature rankings and priorities
- Eliminate manual data entry and reduce inconsistencies

### 1.2 Key Benefits

- **Increased Efficiency**: Eliminate manual copying of information between systems
- **Improved Accuracy**: Reduce errors and ensure consistent data across systems
- **Better Visibility**: View ProductBoard data directly in your development environment
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Bridge the gap between product and development teams
- **Time Savings**: Automate repetitive tasks and focus on higher-value activities

### 1.3 Primary Use Cases

- Synchronizing product roadmaps from ProductBoard to ADO
