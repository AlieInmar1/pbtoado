# Azure DevOps Caching Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

We attempted to implement a server-side synchronization mechanism using Supabase Edge Functions to periodically fetch data from Azure DevOps and store it in Supabase tables. However, testing revealed that Azure DevOps API calls from Supabase Edge Functions were being blocked, likely due to IP restrictions or security policies on the Azure DevOps side.

When we tested the Edge Function with debug information, we observed that all authentication methods (Basic Auth, Bearer Token, and PAT in URL) resulted in a 203 status code and an HTML sign-in page response, indicating that the requests were being redirected to the Azure DevOps sign-in page rather than being processed as API calls.

## Solution Approach

Since we couldn't control the IP address of the Supabase Edge Function, and we knew the API key worked from the frontend, we implemented a frontend-driven caching approach:

1. **Frontend-Initiated Sync**: The frontend application, which has proven ability to connect to Azure DevOps, fetches data directly from the ADO API.

2. **Transparent Caching**: After fetching data from ADO, the frontend automatically caches it in Supabase tables.

3. **Cache-First Retrieval**: Subsequent requests first check the Supabase cache before making calls to ADO.

4. **Fallback Mechanism**: If ADO API calls fail, the system falls back to cached data when available.

5. **Manual Sync Option**: An admin interface allows users to manually trigger a full sync of all ADO data.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Caching API Layer

We created a new file `src/lib/api/azureDevOpsWithCache.ts` that wraps the original API functions from `src/lib/api/azureDevOps.ts` with caching behavior:

- Added logic to check Supabase cache first, then fall back to direct API calls
- Implemented automatic caching of fetched data using Supabase's `upsert` operation
- Added fallback mechanisms for when API calls fail

### 2. Updated React Hooks

Modified the existing hooks to use the new caching-enabled API:

- Updated `src/hooks/useAzureDevOps.ts` to import from `azureDevOpsWithCache.ts`
- Updated `src/hooks/useAzureDevOpsHierarchy.ts` to import from `azureDevOpsWithCache.ts`

### 3. Added Manual Sync Component

Created a new component `src/components/admin/AzureDevOpsSyncButton.tsx` that allows users to manually trigger a full sync of all Azure DevOps data:

- Implemented a button that calls the `syncAllData` function from `azureDevOpsWithCache.ts`
- Added status indicators and error handling
- Integrated the component into the Admin page

### 4. Disabled Edge Function

Modified the Edge Function to return a message indicating that sync should be triggered from the frontend:

- Commented out the original sync logic
- Added a clear message explaining why the Edge Function is disabled
- Kept the original code for reference

### 5. Added Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

- Created `docs/architecture/ADO_CACHING_STRATEGY.md` with detailed information about the caching strategy
- Updated the main README.md with information about the caching strategy
- Created this summary document

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Reliability**: By leveraging the frontend's proven ability to connect to ADO, we avoid the IP restriction issues.

2. **Performance**: Cached data reduces the need for frequent API calls to ADO.

3. **Offline Capabilities**: The cache provides a fallback when ADO is unavailable.

4. **Reduced API Usage**: Minimizes the number of API calls to ADO, helping to stay within rate limits.

5. **Simplicity**: No need for complex server-side infrastructure or workarounds.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

1. **Freshness**: Data may become stale if not regularly synced.

2. **User Dependency**: Initial data population and refreshes depend on user action.

3. **Future Improvements**:
   - Implement selective sync options
   - Add differential updates
   - Explore options for scheduled background syncs
   - Implement more sophisticated conflict resolution
   - Add time-based cache invalidation
