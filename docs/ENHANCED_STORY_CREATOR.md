## Overview

The enhanced Story Creator system provides a comprehensive solution for creating, managing, and pushing stories to ProductBoard. It features hierarchical context awareness, standardized scoring metrics, and intelligent AI recommendations that adapt based on the current editing context.

## Parent Feature Selection

Stories can now be properly organized in a hierarchical structure using the new ParentFeatureSelector component.

### Key Features:
- Searchable dropdown of available features from ProductBoard
- Component filtering to show only relevant features
- Proper parent-child relationship establishment
- Visual indicators for selected parent features

### Implementation:
The ParentFeatureSelector component provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a parent feature:

```tsx
<ParentFeatureSelector
  selectedParentId={story.parent_feature_id}
  componentId={story.component_id}
  onChange={(id, name) => {
    handleFieldChange('parent_feature_id', id);
    handleFieldChange('parent_feature_name', name);
  }}
  required={true}
/>
```

When a story is pushed to ProductBoard, the parent relationship is preserved, creating proper feature hierarchies.

## RICE+ Scoring System

The scoring system has been standardized using a consistent 20-point increment scale for most metrics, aligning with organizational standards.

### RICE+ Metrics:

#### 1. Reach (0-100)
How many users will be affected in a defined time frame.

| Score | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| 0     | Impacts <100 users or a single client with no expansion potential |
| 20    | Small niche or one-off client need (<1,000 users) |
| 40    | Moderate group of users (1,000–5,000 users or 1–2 clients) |
| 60    | Large internal client base or one key client with broad footprint (5,000–10,000 users) |
| 80    | Impacts a broad segment across the portfolio or multiple clients (10,000–50,000 users) |
| 100   | Impacts the entire user base or customer network (>50,000 users) |

#### 2. Impact (0-100)
Degree of benefit for each user impacted.

| Score | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| 0     | Minimal or unclear benefit to the user |
| 20    | Minor improvement (e.g., slight UX polish, non-critical config) |
| 40    | Moderate utility or usability benefit; may reduce friction |
| 60    | Key workflow improvement or small revenue/profit boost |
| 80    | Major time savings, efficiency gains, or user satisfaction increase |
| 100   | Game-changer—directly impacts retention, adoption, or ROI |

#### 3. Confidence (0-100)
Certainty in your Reach, Impact, and Effort assumptions.

| Score | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| 0     | Complete guess; no data |
| 20    | Low confidence; anecdotal input only |
| 40    | Some validation (e.g., directional customer feedback) |
| 60    | Good validation or qualitative data from multiple sources |
| 80    | Strong data-backed assumptions; early test results |
| 100   | High certainty, backed by solid data, prototypes, or prior learnings |

#### 4. Effort
Total team time across disciplines needed to complete the work (in person-months).

| Score | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| 0.5   | Anything less than 1 person-month |
| 1+    | All estimates should be at least 1 but can include decimals (e.g., 1.5 person-months) |

#### 5. OS Compatibility (0-100)
Strategic alignment with HealthcareOS.

| Score | Guidance |
|-------|----------|
| 0     | No alignment with OS strategy |
| 20    | Custom client use case; unlikely to scale |
| 40    | Could be adapted for OS with effort |
| 60    | Generally supports OS model, with some rework |
| 80    | Strong alignment and scalable across OS |
| 100   | Built with OS strategy at its core; immediately portable and prioritized |

### Implementation:
The RICE scoring section has been updated to use standardized increments with detailed guidance for each score level.

## Context-Aware AI Assistance

The AI recommendation system is now context-aware, providing relevant suggestions based on the section being edited.

### Key Features:
- Adapts recommendations based on the active form section
- Provides specific RICE+ scoring suggestions with explanations
- Offers acceptance criteria recommendations based on story description
- Suggests related features and dependencies
- Estimates optimal effort scores based on complexity analysis

### Implementation:
The AIRecommendationPanel now monitors the active section and adjusts its prompt construction and display:

```tsx
// Example of contextual prompting
const buildPrompt = (section: string, story: Partial<Story>) => {
  switch(section) {
    case 'rice':
      return `Analyze this story and suggest appropriate RICE+ scores with explanations:
      Title: ${story.title}
      Description: ${story.description}`;
    case 'content':
      return `Suggest detailed acceptance criteria for this story:
      Title: ${story.title}
      Description: ${story.description}`;
    // other sections...
  }
};
```

## ProductBoard Integration

The enhanced ProductBoard integration allows for more precise control over how stories are pushed to ProductBoard.

### Key Features:
- Parent-child relationship preservation
- Component selection with visual indicators
- Status override options
- Custom field mapping
- Detailed push status reporting

### Implementation:
The ProductBoardPushButton component now supports additional options:

```tsx
<ProductBoardPushButton
  item={story}
  onSuccess={handleProductBoardSuccess}
  onError={handleProductBoardError}
  buttonText={story.productboard_id ? 'Update in ProductBoard' : 'Push to ProductBoard'}
  buttonSize="sm"
  showOptions={true}
/>
```

## Conclusion

The enhanced AI Story/Feature Creator represents a significant improvement in the story creation workflow, with standardized scoring, hierarchical organization, and intelligent AI assistance. This should lead to more consistent, higher-quality story definitions that align better with organizational objectives and integration with ProductBoard.
