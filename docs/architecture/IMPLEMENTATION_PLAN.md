## 1. Overview

We'll use an incremental, module-by-module approach to the rebuild, focusing on creating a clean, maintainable architecture that follows modern React best practices. Our implementation strategy prioritizes:

1. **Early Visual Progress**: Create the UI components early to demonstrate progress
2. **Feature Isolation**: Build one feature module at a time
3. **Continuous Integration**: Regular integration into the main application
4. **Test-Driven Development**: Tests alongside implementation
5. **Documentation First**: Clear documentation before implementation

## 2. Phase 1: Foundation Setup

**Goal**: Establish the project foundation with proper tooling and basic structure.

### 2.1 Project Setup and Configuration

## 8. Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Phase 1: Foundation | 1 week | Project structure, build setup, documentation |
| Phase 2: Core UI | 2 weeks | Component library, design system implementation |
| Phase 3: Feature Modules | 6 weeks | All feature modules with mock data |
| Phase 4: Backend Integration | 3 weeks | Real data flows, API integration |
| Phase 5: Testing & Refinement | 2 weeks | Test coverage, performance optimization |
| Phase 6: Production | 1 week | Production deployment, monitoring |

**Total Duration**: 15 weeks

### Key Milestones

1. **Week 1**: Project foundation ready
2. **Week 3**: UI component library complete
3. **Week 5**: First feature module (Authentication) complete
4. **Week 9**: All feature modules complete with mock data
5. **Week 12**: Backend integration complete
6. **Week 14**: Testing and refinement complete
7. **Week 15**: Production deployment

## Implementation Approach

We'll use a feature-focused approach:

1. Start with the UI components for a feature
2. Implement mock data flows
3. Create hooks and state management
4. Connect to real APIs
5. Test and refine
6. Document and move to the next feature

This ensures we have working, demonstrable features throughout the development process.
