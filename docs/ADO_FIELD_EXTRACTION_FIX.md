# Azure DevOps Field Extraction Fix

## Issue Summary

A critical bug was identified in the Azure DevOps integration where only the basic fields (`id`, `rev`, and `url`) were being properly extracted and saved to the database, while all other fields (title, state, description, etc.) were missing.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `getField` helper function within `src/lib/api/azureDevOpsWithCacheProxy.ts`. This function was incorrectly trying to handle dot notation by splitting field paths and using `reduce` to access nested properties.

```typescript
// INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION
const getField = (path: string, defaultValue: any = null) => {
  return path.split('.').reduce((obj, key) => (obj && obj[key] !== undefined) ? obj[key] : defaultValue, fields);
};
```

The Azure DevOps API returns fields with names like `System.Title`, `System.State`, etc., but these are not nested objects - they're flat fields with dots in their names. So the `reduce` function was trying to access nested properties that don't exist.

For example, when trying to access `System.Title`, it was splitting it into `['System', 'Title']` and trying to access `fields['System']['Title']`, but the actual structure is `fields['System.Title']`.

## Solution

The solution was to modify the `getField` function to directly access the fields without splitting the path:

```typescript
// CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION
const getField = (path: string, defaultValue: any = null) => {
  // Direct field access (no dot notation needed for top-level fields)
  return fields[path] !== undefined ? fields[path] : defaultValue;
};
```

This matches the approach used in the test script `test-ado-mapping.js`, which was working correctly.

## Verification

After implementing the fix, a full sync was performed and all fields were properly extracted and saved to the database. The Azure DevOps integration now correctly displays all work item data including titles, descriptions, states, and all other fields.

## Lessons Learned

1. **API Response Structure Understanding**: It's crucial to understand the exact structure of API responses. In this case, the Azure DevOps API uses dot notation in field names, but they're not actually nested objects.

2. **Test Script Consistency**: The test script (`test-ado-mapping.js`) was correctly accessing the fields, but the production code was using a different approach. Ensuring consistency between test and production code could have prevented this issue.

3. **Field Extraction Validation**: Adding more comprehensive logging and validation of field extraction would have made this issue easier to identify and debug.

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Add Field Extraction Tests**: Create unit tests specifically for field extraction to ensure that fields are being correctly accessed.

2. **Consistent Helper Functions**: Use the same helper functions across test and production code to ensure consistency.

3. **Enhanced Logging**: Add more detailed logging for field extraction, especially during development and testing phases.

4. **API Response Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation about the structure of external API responses to avoid similar misunderstandings in the future.
