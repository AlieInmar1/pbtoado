# AI-Powered Idea to Story Generator

## Overview

The Idea to Story Generator is a sophisticated AI-driven tool that helps product managers, developers, and stakeholders transform simple ideas into fully structured features and stories that are ready for implementation. By leveraging artificial intelligence, it streamlines the creation process while maintaining hierarchical relationships within your product structure.

## Key Capabilities

### Hierarchical Context Management

- **Feature or Story Creation:** Generate either standalone features or implementation stories that are linked to parent features
- **Component Integration:** Associate new items with specific product components to maintain proper organization
- **Parent-Child Relationships:** For stories, establish clear connections to parent features ensuring traceability and coherence

### Intelligent Content Generation

- **Smart Title Creation:** Automatically generate titles based on context, component, and idea description
- **Contextual Descriptions:** Create detailed descriptions that incorporate references to components and parent features
- **Structured Acceptance Criteria:** Generate comprehensive acceptance criteria tailored to the idea type and purpose

### Streamlined Content Organization

- **Hierarchical Context:** Maintains proper relationships between component, feature, and story
- **Consistent Formatting:** Ensures all content follows organizational standards and best practices
- **Enhanced Handoff:** Prepares content for RICE scoring and final refinement in the full editor

### Streamlined Workflow

1. Select item type (feature or story)
2. Choose the relevant component
3. For stories, select a parent feature
4. Enter your idea description
5. Generate the structured content
6. Review and edit the generated content
7. Continue to the full editor for RICE scoring and final refinements

## Benefits

- **Time Savings:** Reduce the time spent formatting and structuring product items
- **Consistency:** Ensure all features and stories follow organizational standards and best practices
- **Quality:** Generate comprehensive details that might otherwise be overlooked
- **Traceability:** Maintain proper relationships between items in your product hierarchy
- **Preparation:** Get structured content ready for formal RICE scoring in the main editor

## Technical Implementation

The system leverages a sophisticated AI model to:

1. Analyze the input idea and hierarchical context
2. Generate appropriate title, description and acceptance criteria formats based on item type
3. Suggest relevant tags and investment categories
4. Format all content to align with organizational standards
5. Build proper metadata relationships for integration with product management systems

## Integration Points

- **ProductBoard:** Items can be directly pushed to ProductBoard maintaining all hierarchical relationships
- **Feature Explorer:** Generated items appear in the Feature Explorer with proper parent-child relationships
- **Story Creator:** Seamless transition to the full Story Creator for additional refinements
- **Workspace Context:** All generated items respect the current workspace context for proper organization

## Best Practices

- Provide concise but descriptive idea entries
- Always select the most specific component possible
- For stories, choose the most directly relevant parent feature
- Review and adjust RICE scores based on organizational standards
- Edit generated content to add specific details as needed
