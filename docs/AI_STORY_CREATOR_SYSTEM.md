# AI-Powered Story Creator System

## System Overview

The AI Story Creator is a sophisticated system designed to streamline the creation and management of product stories and features. It leverages artificial intelligence to provide context-aware suggestions, automate repetitive tasks, and ensure consistency across the product development process.

## Key Components

### 1. Story Creation Wizard

The multi-step wizard guides users through the process of creating well-structured stories:

- **Basic Information**: Title, description, and ownership details
- **Classification**: Investment category, commitment status, and other metadata
- **Detailed Content**: Acceptance criteria and implementation details
- **RICE Scoring**: Structured evaluation of reach, impact, confidence, and effort
- **Planning**: Timeframe, dependencies, and implementation strategy
- **Review**: Final validation before submission

### 2. Idea-to-Story Generator

This component allows users to quickly transform simple ideas into structured stories:

- **Hierarchical Context**: Associates ideas with components and parent features
- **Smart Content Generation**: Creates titles, descriptions, and acceptance criteria based on idea context
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Establishes proper hierarchical connections
- **Content Format**: Ensures all generated content follows organizational standards
- **Seamless Transition**: Integrates with the full wizard for further refinement and RICE scoring

### 3. Context-Aware AI Helper

Provides intelligent recommendations based on the current editing context:

- **Section-Specific Suggestions**: Different recommendations based on which part of the story is being edited
- **Content Recommendations**: Suggests acceptance criteria, planning details, and other text content
- **Relationship Recommendations**: Suggests appropriate parent-child relationships
- **Apply on Demand**: Users can choose which suggestions to apply

### 4. ProductBoard Integration

Enables seamless synchronization with ProductBoard:

- **Push Stories**: Send completed stories to ProductBoard with correct formatting
- **Maintain Relationships**: Preserve parent-child relationships in the ProductBoard hierarchy
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Track changes between systems
- **Status Reporting**: View synchronization status and history

## Workflow

1. Users can start with either a blank story or generate one from an idea
2. The wizard guides users through completing all necessary sections
3. AI provides contextual recommendations throughout the process
4. RICE scoring is performed in a dedicated step to ensure proper evaluation
5. Stories can be saved as drafts or submitted directly
6. Once complete, stories can be pushed to ProductBoard for broader visibility

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: React components with TypeScript 
- **Backend**: 
  - Supabase for data storage
  - Supabase Edge Functions for AI processing
  - Integration with ProductBoard API
- **AI Processing**:
  - Text generation for content recommendations
  - Analysis of existing stories for pattern recognition
  - Context-aware suggestion generation

## Design Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Essential information first, details later
2. **Contextual Assistance**: AI help when and where it's needed
3. **Consistent Structure**: Standardized format across all stories
4. **Hierarchical Context**: Maintain proper relationships between components
5. **User Control**: AI suggests, but users decide
