# Sidebar Issue Resolution

## Problem
The application was experiencing an issue where a sidebar navigation component was causing layout problems, taking over the screen, and creating inconsistent UI.

## Solution
The issue was resolved by:

1. **Complete App.tsx Rewrite**:
   - Rebuilt the main application shell with a horizontal-only navigation pattern
   - Removed all references to sidebar layouts
   - Ensured proper routing and page transitions

2. **Removed Problem Components**:
   - Deleted `src/components/layout/` directory which contained:
     - SidebarLayout.tsx
     - NavSidebar.tsx
     - NavGroup.tsx
     - PageHeader.tsx (moved to UI components if needed)

3. **Added Clean UI Components**:
   - Implemented simple, standalone UI components
   - Ensured components don't have any layout dependencies
   - Used a card-based approach for content areas

## Result
The application now correctly displays with a horizontal navigation bar at the top, and all content pages render properly without sidebar interference.

## Future Recommendations
- Maintain the flat component hierarchy
- Avoid nested layout wrappers
- Use the Card component for content sectioning instead of full-page layouts
