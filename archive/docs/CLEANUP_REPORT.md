# Project Cleanup Report

This document summarizes the cleanup process applied to the ProductBoard to ADO Integration project.

## Actions Performed

### 1. Documentation Archiving

- Created a well-organized documentation archive in `/docs/archive/`
- Categorized documentation into logical groups:
  - API & Integration
  - Token Extraction
  - Hierarchy
  - Rankings
  - Deployment
  - Fixes
  - Legacy
- Created a comprehensive index for easy document discovery
- Preserved critical documentation in original locations for immediate access

### 2. Test & Debug File Cleanup

- Removed test files from the root directory and submodules
- Eliminated debug scripts that are no longer needed
- Removed development-only files that aren't essential for production
- Preserved core testing frameworks and utilities

### 3. Deployment Script Cleanup

- Removed one-time deployment scripts
- Eliminated duplicate deployment files
- Maintained documentation of deployment procedures in the archive

### 4. Duplicate & Experimental Implementation Cleanup

- Removed duplicate component versions
- Eliminated deprecated Supabase function implementations
- Removed experimental code that was superseded by production implementations
- Cleaned up one-time SQL migration files that have already been applied

### 5. Project Documentation

- Created `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` describing the core components and their functionality
- Mapped key files to their respective responsibilities
- Documented primary workflows and system architecture

## Preserved Components

The following core components were carefully preserved throughout the cleanup:

1. **User Interface (UI)**
   - All ProductBoard-specific UI components
   - Main application pages
   - Reusable UI components

2. **ProductBoard Connectivity**
   - Token management system
   - Data extraction functionality
   - ProductBoard API interactions

3. **ADO Integration**
   - Core synchronization logic
   - ADO API communication
   - Data transformation utilities

4. **Database & Storage**
   - Supabase client setup
   - Database schema definitions
   - Migration scripts

5. **Serverless Functions**
   - Token refresh functions
   - ProductBoard data sync functions
   - Validation utilities

6. **pb-sync & pb-connect Modules**
   - API interaction utilities
   - Synchronization logic
   - Database operations

## Next Steps

### Module Assessment

Consider evaluating whether to maintain both `pb-sync` and `pb-simple` modules. They have some overlapping functionality, and you might want to consolidate them to further streamline the codebase.

### Testing Review

The cleanup process removed many test files, but you may want to establish a more structured testing approach going forward. Consider setting up a dedicated `tests` directory with organized test suites.

### Environment Configuration

Review the `.env.fixed` file and consider standardizing your environment configuration. Creating a comprehensive `.env.example` file would help with future deployments.

### Dependencies Review

Review `package.json` to identify and remove any unused dependencies that may have been related to removed functionality.

### Documentation Updates

The documentation archive contains valuable information, but you might want to create new, streamlined documentation focused on the current implementation to make onboarding easier.
