   - UI supports filtering, sorting, and searching
   - Integration with existing components completed

3. **Documentation** ✅
   - Deployment guides created
   - Usage documentation complete
   - Implementation summary provided

## Deployment Status

1. **Database Changes** ✅ DEPLOYED
   - `supabase/direct-rankings-migration.sql` has been executed
   - All necessary tables and views are created

2. **Function Deployment** ⏳ PENDING
   - Due to Deno installation issues, the function deployment is pending
   - Alternative deployment options provided in `supabase-function-deploy-alternatives.md`

## What You Can Do Now

Even before deploying the function, you can:

1. Browse the new UI and familiarize yourself with the components
2. Run the app locally to view the interface structure
3. Review the SQL schema to understand the data organization

## Next Steps

To complete the deployment:

1. Choose one of the deployment options from `supabase-function-deploy-alternatives.md`
2. After deploying the function, test the full workflow:
   - Extract rankings from ProductBoard
   - View and filter the stored rankings
   - Sync to Azure DevOps when ready

## Future Enhancements

Consider these enhancements for future iterations:

1. Add batch selection of items to sync
2. Create visualizations of ranking trends over time
3. Set up automatic notifications for significant ranking changes
4. Implement ranking comparisons between boards

## Final Notes

The implementation follows a modular architecture that makes it easy to extend with additional features. The database schema is designed to efficiently track historical changes while the UI provides intuitive access to this data.

Once the function is deployed, you'll have a complete solution for tracking ProductBoard rankings with historical context and controlled synchronization to Azure DevOps.
