# ProductBoard Ranking Extraction: Complete Two-Step Approach Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a robust two-step approach for ProductBoard ranking extraction and Azure DevOps synchronization:

1. **Step 1: Token Capture** - Previously implemented to securely capture and store ProductBoard authentication tokens in the database
2. **Step 2: Token-Based Ranking Extraction** - Enhanced to retrieve rankings using stored tokens and sync them to Azure DevOps

This implementation eliminates the need for username/password authentication during the extraction process, making it more secure and reliable.

## Key Components

### 1. Token-Based Extraction Function

The `extractRankingsUsingTokens` function in `sync-productboard-rankings/index.ts` has been enhanced to:

- Always use the newest valid token from the database
- Handle cookie format conversions for Puppeteer compatibility
- Validate token expiration before use
- Update token usage metrics in the database

### 2. Robust Extraction Logic

The `scrapeProductBoardWithTokens` function has been improved with:

- Multiple selector strategies to handle different ProductBoard UI layouts
- Fallback mechanisms when standard selectors fail
- Proper positioning-based ranking calculation
- Enhanced pattern matching for different ID formats
- Better error handling and logging

### 3. Local Testing Script

A standalone test script `test-token-ranking-extraction.js` allows for easy local testing:

- Gets the newest token from the database
- Normalizes cookies for browser authentication
- Extracts rankings from ProductBoard
- Saves results to a local file
- Generates a screenshot for debugging

### 4. Updated GitHub Action

The GitHub workflow has been updated to use the token-based approach:

- Calls the Supabase function directly with appropriate parameters
- Sets the scraping service to 'token' mode
- Processes each enabled board
- Reports success/failure for each board

## Benefits of the Two-Step Approach

1. **Enhanced Security**: No need to store passwords or handle login pages
2. **Improved Reliability**: Reduced chance of authentication failures
3. **Better Maintainability**: Clear separation between token capture and data extraction
4. **Increased Flexibility**: Can use different extraction strategies as needed
5. **Simplified Debugging**: Screenshots and detailed logs help identify issues

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Use the local test script to verify token-based extraction works
2. Check the Supabase function using the dashboard invoker
3. Manually trigger the GitHub Action to verify the end-to-end process

## Next Steps

If a token becomes invalid or expires:

1. The system will automatically mark it as invalid
2. Users will be prompted to capture a new token
3. The next extraction cycle will use the new token

## Token Management Recommendations

- Refresh tokens regularly (tokens typically last 2-4 weeks)
- Monitor token usage and validity in the dashboard
- Implement proactive token validation to ensure availability
