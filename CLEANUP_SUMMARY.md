# Project Cleanup Summary

This document outlines the cleanup process that was performed on the project to streamline the codebase, remove extraneous components, and preserve the core working functionality.

## Cleanup Process

1. **Identified Core Components**
   - Analyzed the codebase to determine which components were essential to the working functionality
   - Focused on preserving ProductBoard API integration and Azure DevOps connectivity
   - Maintained UI components necessary for visualization and interaction

2. **Removed Extraneous Code**
   - Removed test files and debugging utilities not needed for production
   - Eliminated experimental features that were not part of the core functionality
   - Cleaned up duplicate implementations and outdated approaches

3. **Consolidated API Integration**
   - Streamlined ProductBoard API interaction into a single, well-defined module
   - Centralized Azure DevOps API connectivity for better maintainability
   - Improved token-based authentication mechanisms

4. **Organized Project Structure**
   - Created a cleaner, more intuitive folder structure
   - Separated UI components from business logic
   - Improved type definitions for better code reliability

## What Was Preserved

1. **ProductBoard Connectivity**
   - Token-based authentication
   - Feature fetching and hierarchy visualization
   - Ranking extraction and synchronization

2. **Azure DevOps Integration**
   - Work item creation and updating
   - Bidirectional synchronization with ProductBoard
   - Field mapping and relationship maintenance

3. **User Interface**
   - Core UI components for data visualization
   - Feature hierarchy display
   - Status indicators and interactive elements

4. **Data Management**
   - Supabase connectivity for persistent storage
   - Change tracking and history management
   - Type definitions for strong typing

## What Was Removed

1. **Experimental Code**
   - Incomplete or non-functional features
   - Alternative approaches that were abandoned
   - Redundant implementations of the same functionality

2. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Ad-hoc test scripts not part of a formal testing framework
   - Debugging utilities and temporary solutions
   - Console logs and diagnostic code

3. **Documentation Drafts**
   - Outdated or superseded documentation
   - Multiple versions of the same instructions
   - Temporary notes and implementation plans

4. **Legacy Code**
   - Deprecated API implementations
   - Code that was commented out or unused
   - Functions replaced by more efficient alternatives

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Smaller, more focused codebase
   - Clearer separation of concerns
   - Better organized project structure

2. **Enhanced Performance**
   - Removal of unused code reduces bundle size
   - Elimination of redundant operations
   - More efficient implementation patterns

3. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Easier onboarding for new team members
   - Simplified debugging and troubleshooting
   - Clearer documentation of core functionality

This cleanup preserves all essential functionality while making the codebase more maintainable, efficient, and easier to understand.
